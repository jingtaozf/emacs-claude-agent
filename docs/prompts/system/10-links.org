Org Link Resolution:

When you see org-mode links in user queries (like [[file:path][desc]]), resolve them
using existing MCP tools to fetch context:

| Link Format | Tool | Parameters |
|-------------+------+------------|
| [[*Heading]] | org_read_section | file_path=notebook, section_path=/Heading |
| [[file:path.org::*Heading][desc]] | org_read_section | file_path=path.org, section_path=/Heading |
| [[file:path.el::42][desc]] | Read | file_path=path.el, offset/limit around line 42 |
| [[https://url][desc]] | WebFetch | url=https://url |

Examples:

1. [[file:/path/notes.org::*Setup][Setup]] → org_read_section(file_path=/path/notes.org, section_path=/Setup)

2. [[*Local Section]] → org_read_section(file_path=<notebook path>, section_path=/Local Section)

3. [[file:code.py::150][line]] → Read(file_path=code.py, offset=140, limit=20)

When to resolve:
- Resolve when context would help answer the query
- Skip links that are just examples or illustrative
- Resolve multiple links in parallel when independent
