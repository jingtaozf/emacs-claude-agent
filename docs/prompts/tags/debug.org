* DEBUG MODE

Systematic debugging workflow:

1. Capture error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Form and test hypotheses

For each issue provide:
- Root cause explanation with evidence
- Suggested fix with file:line references
- Testing approach to verify the fix
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on documenting the underlying issue, not just symptoms.
