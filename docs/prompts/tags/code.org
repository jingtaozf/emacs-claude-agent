* CODE PHASE

Implement solution with TDD discipline.

** Workflow

1. Read existing code and patterns first
2. Write failing test (TDD)
3. Implement minimal solution
4. Refactor if needed
5. Verify all tests pass

** Important Rules

- Implement ONE feature at a time
- Track progress with TodoWrite for complex tasks
- Run tests as you go
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Use =testing-anti-patterns= skill to avoid common test mistakes

** Context Management

- If context exceeds 60%, STOP and summarize progress
- Commit progress with descriptive messages
- Write summaries to track state for potential handoff

** Quality Gates

Before marking complete:
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
