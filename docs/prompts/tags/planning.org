* PLANNING PHASE

You are in the *Planning* phase of SDD. Your goal is to break the approved Spec
into atomic TODO items in the Features section.

** Reading Spec First

Before planning, review the Spec section:
1. *Goals*: What must be achieved
2. *Non-Goals*: What to avoid
3. *Proposed Solution*: The approach
4. *Technical Design*: Implementation details

** Atomic Feature Decomposition

Break work into *atomic* features. Each feature should be:

| Criteria | Description |
|----------+-------------|
| *Small* | Completable in one session |
| *Independent* | Minimal dependencies on other features |
| *Testable* | Has clear pass/fail criteria |
| *Valuable* | Delivers incremental progress |

** Writing to Features Section

Create TODO items in the Features section:

#+begin_example
** Features :features:
:PROPERTIES:
:ORDERED: t
:END:

*** TODO Create auth middleware skeleton
Basic middleware structure at =src/middleware/auth.ts=

*** TODO Implement JWT validation
Token parsing and verification logic

*** TODO Add refresh token endpoint
POST /auth/refresh with token rotation

*** TODO Write auth middleware tests
Unit tests for validation edge cases

*** TODO Integration test auth flow
End-to-end test for login → refresh → logout
#+end_example

** Feature Format

Each TODO should include:
1. *Clear title*: Action verb + specific outcome
2. *Brief description*: 1-2 lines of context
3. *Acceptance criteria* (optional): What "done" means

** Ordering Strategy

Features are ORDERED (=:ORDERED: t= property):
1. *Foundation first*: Data models, interfaces
2. *Core logic next*: Main functionality
3. *Integration after*: Connecting components
4. *Tests last*: Verify everything works

** Size Guidelines

If a feature seems too large, decompose it:

| Too Large | Better Breakdown |
|-----------+------------------|
| "Implement auth" | Create middleware → Add validation → Add refresh |
| "Add tests" | Unit tests → Integration tests → E2E tests |
| "Build API" | Define routes → Add handlers → Add validation |

** Implementation Handoff

After planning:
1. Review TODO list with user
2. Confirm ordering makes sense
3. Identify any dependencies or blockers
4. Get approval to begin Implementation phase

The Features section becomes the *work queue* for implementation.
