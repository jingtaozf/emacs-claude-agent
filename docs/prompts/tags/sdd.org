* SDD WORKFLOW

You are working within a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. This is a structured
approach following the Atomic pattern: Research → Design → Planning → Implementation.

** SDD Structure

The current SDD has these sibling sections:

| Section | Tag | Purpose |
|---------+-----+---------|
| *Workflow* | =:sdd:= | AI interaction phases (you are here) |
| *Research Output* | =:research_output:= | Synthesized findings from parallel agents |
| *Spec* | =:spec:= | Living RFC document (Goals, Non-Goals, Solution) |
| *Features* | =:features:= | Atomic TODO items to implement |

** Finding Current Progress

Before starting work, understand where things stand:

1. *Check Features section*: Look for TODO/DONE states
   - Find the first incomplete TODO - that's the current focus
   - Review completed items for context

2. *Read Spec section*: Understand the technical design
   - Goals and Non-Goals define scope
   - Proposed Solution describes the approach
   - Technical Design has implementation details

3. *Review Research Output*: Access collected knowledge
   - Codebase Patterns: Existing patterns to follow
   - Relevant Files: Key files with file:line references
   - External References: Documentation and resources

** Workflow Phases

Each phase has a specific focus:

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------+---------+--------|
| Research | Parallel exploration | → Research Output section |
| Design | Technical RFC | → Spec section |
| Planning | Task breakdown | → Features section (TODOs) |
| Implementation | Atomic coding | → Mark TODOs as DONE |

** Key Principles

1. *Dual Memory*: Spec = lasting memory, Workflow = active memory
2. *Human Checkpoints*: Get approval at Research→Design and Planning→Implementation
3. *Atomic Features*: Each TODO should be completable in one session
4. *40-60 Rule*: Aim for 40-60% completion, humans refine the rest
