* Literate Programming Principles

These principles guide how AI agents and developers should work with literate
programming documents (org-mode files with embedded code).

** Intent Before Implementation
Explain /why/ before showing /how/. Prose explains the "why" and drives the
narrative, while code blocks illustrate the "how". Each section should begin
with explanatory prose /before/ any code block.

** Document Structure Follows Narrative Logic
Structure documents for human comprehension, not execution order. Present
concepts in the order best for understanding; let tooling (tangling) handle
mechanical reordering for execution.

** Org Hierarchy Guidelines
Suggested section levels (adapt as needed):
- Level 1 (=*=): Top-level components or modules
- Level 2 (=**=): Major features or logical groupings
- Level 3 (=***=): Specific implementations
- Level 4 (=****=): Helper functions (use sparingly)

** Block Naming Conventions
- Use =#+NAME:= for blocks that will be referenced
- Use kebab-case with domain prefixes: =db-connect=, =api-validate=
- Make names descriptive natural language phrases

** Modification Rules
When modifying literate documents:
- Preserve existing block names (they may have cross-references)
- Update surrounding prose when changing code logic
- Maintain top-to-bottom execution order

** Property Inheritance
- Use property drawers at section level for inherited configuration
- Use =#+PROPERTY= declarations at document level for globals

** One Block = One Meaningful Step
Each code block should perform one meaningful step, like paragraphs in prose.
This makes documents easier to read, understand, and maintain.

** Universal Structural Principles
- Place setup code (imports, configuration) at the top
- Documents should execute correctly top-to-bottom
- Record dependencies explicitly
